# Changelog

All notable changes to WKNDR. We're pre-1.0 (0.x = build-for-self validation phase).
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). The version
shown in the app's "What's feeding this" sheet matches the latest tag here.

## [Unreleased]
- (next up — pick from docs/moat.md §7: "My Weekend" share card · the content pipeline)

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-01 — "Hosted + unified IA"
- **Hosted on GitHub Pages** via a build-and-deploy Action — auto-redeploys on every push to `main`
  (`nessim-higson.github.io/wkndr/`); the `/experiments` design archive is preserved.
- **Weather defaults to the live forecast** (Open-Meteo) instead of a fake toggle; the mode pills
  moved into a tucked-away "Adjust weather" disclosure.
- **Two-axis filtering**: a **When** pill (Any time / This weekend / New / **Evergreen canon** / Ending)
  and a **What** pill (category / kids / saved). The evergreen canon is a *filter*, not a separate
  view — Stack & List stay cojoined (replaced the bolt-on Guide view).
- Uniform swipe-action buttons; removed the condition phrase under the city/temp.
- Source roster is fully clickable (45 sources).
- Targeted permission allowlist so routine commands stop prompting (dev-side).

## [0.3.0] — "Taste + detail"
- **Taste foundation**: saves + swipe history persist (localStorage) and survive reloads; a light
  tag-weight model folds a `taste` term into ranking (weather × freshness × taste). Saved list view.
- **Card detail** view (tap a card / row → full info + "Open at source" link + source-trace).
- **"What's feeding this"** inputs sheet — exposes the weather feed, source roster, ranking, household.
- Category/Kids filters; refresh gets a clear signal (toast + re-deal animation).

## [0.2.0] — "Real content"
- Replaced sample picks with **real, hand-curated Amsterdam events**; deepened the pool to **48 picks**
  across all categories (gigs, openings, museums, parks, markets, day-trips).
- **Real subject images** pulled from Wikipedia/Wikimedia (the actual venues + artists).
- Tag differentiation (status / classifier / context roles).

## [0.1.0] — "Phase 1 scaffold"
- Vite + React + TypeScript + Framer Motion app (run with Bun).
- Weather-reactive field (5 modes, crossfade), swipe **Stack**, **List**, weather × freshness ranking,
  sample Amsterdam pool, live-weather + demo controls.
